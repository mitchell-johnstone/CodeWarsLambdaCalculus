# Code Wars lambda calculus track
This document lists the problems I've completed and the 
suggested order they be attempted to allow for maximum cohesion

## Church boolean: [https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ac739ed3fdf73d3f0000048/train/lambdacalc]
Defines the basic of boolean algebra

## Lambda Calculus: Lists: [https://www.codewars.com/kata/5eecd4a5e5d13e000150e249/solutions]
Gives intro into one way that lists are represented in lambda calculus, using pairs

## Lists as folds I: [https://www.codewars.com/kata/5fb44fbd98799a0021dca93a]

## Lists as folds II: [https://www.codewars.com/kata/60b76ecdbec5c4003163f869]

## Count By X: [https://www.codewars.com/kata/5513795bd3fafb56c200049e/solutions/lambdacalc]
Before getting into this, might want to look at this reference: [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gulcii-0.3/src/doc/encoding.md]
or maybe this: [https://kseo.github.io/posts/2016-12-13-scott-encoding.html]

Builds off lists, but also uses Scott encodings for numerals. Does a terrible job at explaining how Scott numerals work sadly.

## Currying vs Partial Application: [https://www.codewars.com/kata/53cf7e37e9876c35a60002c9]

## Factorial lambda Calculus: [https://www.codewars.com/kata/factorial-lambda-calculus]
